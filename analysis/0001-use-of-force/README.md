# Taser report: Use of force statistics

- Date: June-July 2020
- Authors: @WheresAlice & @kimadactyl
- Purpose: Resistance Lab Taser Report

Initial work done towards Taser report. This is a deep dive into the Use of Force statistics, which are in a very unfriendly but seemingly complete format. There are three graphs this data is intended for use with:

- Police Taser use disproportional use against Black and Brown people
- Police Taser use against children and young people
- Police Taser use against people with mental and physical health conditions

For each a melted data source has been added. We have also created a data mapping as the source spreadsheet implies a hierarchy of data that doesn't make sense out of context.

Reading the User Guide is essential to interpret these stats.

Collated type of taser use broken down by police force and year

[taser-use-by-force-by-year.csv](taser-use-by-force-by-year.csv)

Note that the reporting dates change from calendar year to financial year part way through this file.  The following year-ends are currently included in this file:

- 2019-03-31
- 2018-03-31
- 2016-12-31
- 2015-12-31

This file only contains individual police forces, so it should be safe to sum the columns

We have similar data for 2009-2010 in `cleaned_data/taser-use/pre-2011`, but because of the big gap this is not included.  We also have similar data covering the entirety of 2004-2010 in the same directory - ie. not broken down by year.

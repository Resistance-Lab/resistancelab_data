- Author: @WheresAlice

A single CSV containing FTE workforce count for police forces in England and Wales

[police-workforce-fte-by-year.csv](police-workforce-fte-by-year.csv)

Totals rows have been removed, so it should be safe to sum and average this data

We use the March numbers to better align to other data which uses financial year

# Police Workforce by Year, 2015-2019

A single CSV containing FTE workforce count for police forces in England and Wales

[police-workforce-fte-by-year.csv](police-workforce-fte-by-year.csv)

Some years have different rows - some include non-geographical forces and totals

We use the March numbers to better align to other data which uses financial year

No test, because the only meaningful test is baked into the python script, asserting that the length of output is equal to the length of the inputs

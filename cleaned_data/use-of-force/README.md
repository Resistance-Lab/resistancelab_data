# Police Use of Force

This data started being published in 2017, and replaces the [taser-use](../taser-use) reporting data as well as adding wider data around police use of force.  It uses financial years rather than calendar years, and so there is some cross-over with the previous reporting by calendar year:

- [by-ced-type-force-region/january-december2016-revised.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/january-december2016-revised.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/january-march2017.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/january-march2017.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/april2017-march2018.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/april2017-march2018.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/april2018-march2019.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/april2018-march2019.csv)

Wider use-of-force incidents:

- [incidents/april2017-march2018.csv](incidents/april2017-march2018.csv)
- [incidents/april2018-march2019.csv](incidents/april2018-march2019.csv)

Use of force by officer-perceived demographics only started being produced in 2019:

- [by-age-force/april2018-march2019.csv](by-age-force/april2018-march2019.csv)
- [by-disability-force/april2018-march2019.csv](by-disability-force/april2018-march2019.csv)
- [by-ethnicity-force/april2018-march2019.csv](by-ethnicity-force/april2018-march2019.csv)

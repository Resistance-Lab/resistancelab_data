# Police Use of Force

This data started being published in 2017, and replaces the [taser-use](../taser-use) reporting data as well as adding wider data around police use of force.  It uses financial years rather than calendar years, and so there is some cross-over with the previous reporting by calendar year:

- [by-ced-type-force-region/january-december2016-revised.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/january-december2016-revised.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/january-march2017.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/january-march2017.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/april2017-march2018.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/april2017-march2018.csv)
- [by-ced-type-force-region/april2018-march2019.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/april2018-march2019.csv)

Total incidents of all use of force (i.e., not just CED). An incident may involve multiple uses of the same type of force, or only the highest level used: we don't know which forces have used which practice at which time.

Use of force by officer-perceived demographics only started being produced in 2019:

- [by-age-force](by-age-force/index.html)
- [by-disability-force](by-disability-force/index.html)
- [by-ethnicity-force](by-ethnicity-force/index.html)

'By disability' stats were retitled to 'by health condition' for the 2019-20 data. As far we we can tell these are functionally identical but we have kept them separate to most closely reflect the source data.

Historical taser usage (prior to the use-of-force reports started)

We've gone back as far as we can with this data, but a lot of the older data is not all that useful.

In rough order of time period:

- [pre-2011/table1-2004-2010-total.csv](pre-2011/table1-2004-2010-total.csv) shows type of taser usage broken down by police force, but covers the entirety of 2004-2010 in each row
- [pre-2011/table2-2009-2010.csv](pre-2011/table2-2009-2010.csv) shows type of taser usage broken down by police force, covering 2009-2010.  The format isn't particularly easy to deal with, but is included for completeness
- [historic-ced-usage/2011-2016.csv](historic-ced-usage/2011-2016.csv) shows type of taser usage by year, but covers the whole of England and Wales and isn't broken down by police force
- [by-ced-type-force-region/2015-revised.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/2015-revised.csv) is where the data starts being more useful.  The data is broken down by type and police force for the calendar year of 2015
- [by-ced-type-force-region/2015-revised.csv](by-ced-type-force-region/2016.csv) similar to the 2015-revised data, but for 2016.  Note that the [use-of-force](../use-of-force) data updates this file.

If you want taser usage by police force broken down by time period in a single file, then you may instead want to use [0004-taser-usage](../../analysis/0004-taser-usage)

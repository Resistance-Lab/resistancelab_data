### Use of force (`source_data/use-of-force`)

> Statistics on incidents where police officers use force; including type of force, reason, outcome, injuries, and subject information (such as age, gender).

This has actual taser information in a simpler format (just drawn and fired), but seems to be the new reporting format that will be used in perpetuity. It has it's own [user guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/763512/user-guide-police-use-of-force.pdf) which is a **must read** to understand this data.

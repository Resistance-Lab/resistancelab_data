# Deaths During or Following Police Contact

This data comes from the [IOPC](https://policeconduct.gov.uk/research-and-learning/statistics/annual-deaths-during-or-following-police-contact-statistics).  It is manually downloaded and shared in this repository because the IOPC website blocks automated downloads.

We include multiple versions of this spreadsheet so that we can compare them.  Investigations take considerable time, and so data from previous years does change in subsequent versions.

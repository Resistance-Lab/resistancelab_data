# Desired outputs

A list of the graphs I'd like to make to go with the forthcoming Taser report. Written as prose to avoid making decisions based on the data.

## 1. Access to tasers in the UK

Show the rapid increase in firearm availability and training. "Tasers are lethal weapons in the arms of more and more cops each year".

 * x: Year
 * y: Taser access either as:
    * Trained officers
    * Total in circulation
 * Interactive: See all firearms data as stacked barplot
 * Interactive: Facet by police force


## 2. Taser deaths worldwide

Show increase in deaths from taser use across the world.

 * x: year
 * y: deaths
 * Interactive: facet by country


## 3. What it's like to be hit by a taser

A bit concerned all the numbers obscure the feeling - can we find something to compare it to, i.e. like getting a mains electric shock?

 * Infographic with similar shocks


## 4. Use of tasers by police in the UK

A big complex one that we can use in various forms for a number of the subsections.

 * x: year
 * y: total incidents with fired/threatened as stacked barplot
 * Interactive: facet by police force
 * Interactive: facet by ethnicity
 * Interactive: facet by age bracket
 * Interactive: facet by mental health condition

Specific drilldowns to show from this in simpler forms

 * Black people more likely to be tased
 * Children more likely to be tased
 * Children under 12 being tased
 * Use in mental health settings
 * Use on people with epilepsy
 * Black children with mental health conditions are % more likely to be tased than their white adult neurotypical counterparts

## 5. Taser use as a threat

Show rising tendancy for police to draw tasers to intimidate

 * x: year
 * y: taser drawn and not fired
 * Interactive: facet by police force

Overall infographic: tasers now fired once for every eight times they are drawn, up from five.

## 6. Other uses of force

Same as 4 but load in other "use of force" data. Think this through more when we get to it though.

## 7. Tasers as a proportion of use of force tactics

Show rising tendency for police to tase people instead of less lethal methods.

 * x: year
 * y: tasers as proportion of all use of force
 * Interactive: facet by police force

## 8. The worst offenders

Infographics to sum up the worst of it.

  * Most taser incidents by force (total count)
  * Force where officers most likely to use a taser (incidents per officer)
  * Force with the highest race disproportionality (more likely to be tased if you're non-white)
  * Ditto children, mental health

# Resistance Labs Datasets

![Run tests](https://github.com/Resistance-Lab/data/workflows/Run%20tests/badge.svg?branch=trunk)

This repository contains both datasets we have collected as well as scripts used to collect them.

## Layout of this repository

Main folders: contain the source, a sensible cleanup, and then a folder for each distinct output.

- [source_data](source_data): raw data sources from government and other state agency websites
- [cleaned_data](cleaned_data): source files tidied into cleaner formats for easier comparison
- [analysis](analysis): a set of folders with workspace environments for each specific output
  - `analysis/0001-use-of-force`: One directory per use case, first one given as an example.
    - `analysis/0001-use-of-force/README.md`: Description of this analysis, where it's used, author info, etc.
    - `analysis/0001-use-of-force/Makefile`: A makefile for generating this analysis (`make`)
    - `analysis/0001-use-of-force/force-mappings.csv`: Mappings to make source metadata more descriptive and easier to read
    - `analysis/0001-use-of-force/use-of-force.py`: Script to create the outputs in this directory
    - `analysis/0001-use-of-force/**/*`: Outputs generated by script

Utility folders

- `.github`: actions to deploy to Netlify
- `bibliography`: BibTeX files
- `pipelines`: populates source directory, cleans data (run `make pipelines` to run them all)

## Source data (`source_data`)

These are the source files used for analysis. Each one maps onto one or more files in `cleaned_data` via a `pipeline`. A `pipeline` may work on multiple source files (e.g. one per year), and a source file may generate multiple `cleaned_data` outputs (e.g. one per sheet in a spreadsheet).

### Police Population (`source_data/police-population`)

Number of police officers per force and per 100,000 population in England and Wales.

### Taser use (`source_data/taser-use`)

> Statistics on police use of TASER X26 conducted energy devices, England and Wales, 2016.

This dataset is the most granular and shows where it has been drawn, arced, red-dotted etc. However it seemingly only exists for this one year, after which it's integrated into the Use of Force data.

### Use of force (`source_data/use-of-force`)

> Statistics on incidents where police officers use force; including type of force, reason, outcome, injuries, and subject information (such as age, gender).

This has actual taser information in a simpler format (just drawn and fired), but seems to be the new reporting format that will be used in perpetuity. It has it's own [user guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/763512/user-guide-police-use-of-force.pdf) which is a **must read** to understand this data.

### UK Demographics (`source_data/demographics`)

Demographic information is sourced from the 2011 UK Census via the "nomisweb" service.

> This dataset provides 2011 estimates that classify usual residents in England and Wales by ethnic group. The ethnic group classification used is the standard 18-category classification corresponding to the tick box response options on the census questionnaire. The estimates are as at census day, 27 March 2011.

## Contributing

If you have relevant datasets then we would like to include them here. We expect datasets to:

* Be automated where possible, with a script in the `scripts` directory
* Come with [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) test suites
* Be documented in the table above

Feel free to open a ticket or email [kim@resistancelab.network](mailto:kim@resistancelab.network) with any questions.

### Testing

Tests are provided using Great Expectations. You will need a recent version of Python installed to use this.  The rest of the dependencies can then be installed with:

1. Run `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` to create a virtual environment
2. Install the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `great_expectations init` to create any missing directories

To create a test suite for your new dataset run `great_expectations suite new`

To edit a test suite run `great expectations suite edit police-population.warning`

To run the tests and show the results run `great_expectations docs build`
